# RunCoach

Project completed as part of CodeClan 16 week intensive Software Development bootcamp.

Android mobile app to plan running sessions for the week and reward the user for consistency in training.

Built in Android Studio to work on Java and mobile development.

## Brief

I produced a custom brief which was approved by the instructor team:

You are required to build an Android app which will allow a user to maintain a list of runs planned for a week and build a habit. The user should be able to add their run types for the week and track which ones they have completed. The list should show basic details of each run, selecting a run would show full details / instructions for how to do that type of run. Users should be able to mark run as completed which will increment a counter. If the user misses a day, it should reset the counter.

Project Extensions
•	Visual representation of counter
•	Positive feedback
